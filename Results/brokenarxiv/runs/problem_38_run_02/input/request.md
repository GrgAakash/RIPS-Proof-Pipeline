Problem 38:
Let the space of lines in $\mathbb{R}^d$ be endowed with the natural topology (the quotient space obtained from the deleted product $\{(x,y) \in \mathbb{R}^d \times \mathbb{R}^d : x \neq y\}$ by considering $(x,y)$ and $(x',y')$ equivalent if they span the same line). For every integer $d \geq 1$ and every finite family of at least two pairwise disjoint open convex sets in $\mathbb{R}^d$, every connected component of the space of line transversals to this family is acyclic (i.e., has trivial reduced homology).



Run a fresh no-history solver-only S0-S6 pipeline on this problem:
Prove the statement.

Use the S0-S6 solver prompts from:
  pipeline_sources/Prompt Packet/Prompts.md

Use only these solver roles:
- S0 Blueprint Solver
- S1-S5 Subproblem Solvers
- S6 Composer Solver

Do not use the Main/Manager roles:
- no Manager Routing
- no Main Solver
- no Manager Assistance Routing
- no Manager Support Admission
- no Defender
- no Manager Acceptance

Do not run a verifier pipeline.

Fresh no-history restrictions:
- Do not use memory, prior task history, previous outputs, answer keys, or files outside the fresh input bundle.
- Do not read the private memory directory.
- Spawn every subagent with fork_turns="none" / fork_context=false.
- Do not use web search or internet.
- Do not use API keys.

Tool and execution restrictions:
- No code execution of any kind for solving.
- Do not use Python, Ruby, Perl, Node/JavaScript, shell scripts, compiled programs, notebooks, CAS tools, awk/sed-based computation, simulations, parsers, or helper programs.
- Do not use terminal commands for mathematical work.
- Permitted tooling only:
  1. read the specified prompt packet file;
  2. spawn fresh no-history S0-S6 subagents with fork_context=false;
  3. collect their outputs.
- File reads are permitted only for the specified prompt packet and any directly necessary prompt-packet metadata needed to locate it.

solver-only S0-S6 defaults:
- max_guidance_rounds = 3
- max_branch_depth = 2
- run S0 once per round
- run S1-S5 fresh from S0 assignments
- run S6 fresh from S0 blueprint + S1-S5 outputs
